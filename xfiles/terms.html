				<td><p>A family seems to be under attack by the Devil.  The police aren't buying it, and instead are blaming the father for the death of a newborn.  However, it turns out that the father is himself a demon, and is trying to father a demon child.  As the mystery unravels, it turns out that the wife is <i>also</i> a demon, and wants her own demon-baby, and has been framing the unknowing father all along.</p></td>

		<h2>I'm Only Happy When It Rains</h2>
		<p>When the demon parents are driving in their convertible, they play this song by Garbage.  It's fitting because demons wouldn't be happy unless some misfortune was occurring.</p>
